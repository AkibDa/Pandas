# Pandas Crash Course Examples

This repository contains code examples from a Pandas crash course, covering essential data manipulation techniques.  The examples demonstrate data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and merging using the Pandas library in Python.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+ (Recommended)
*   Pandas: `pip install pandas`
*   NumPy (if used in your examples): `pip install numpy`  (Highly likely you'll need NumPy with Pandas)

## Repository Structure

│   └── Iris.csv  
│   └── Data.csv 
├── main.py           
└── README.md      

## Usage

1.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (see Prerequisites).
2.  Place your dataset(s) in the `data` folder.  Make sure the filenames in your code match the actual filenames.
3.  Run the Python script `main.py` from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Key Concepts Covered

*   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (e.g., imputation, dropping rows), removing duplicates, data type conversion.
*   **Data Filtering:** Selecting data based on conditions (e.g., filtering rows based on column values).
*   **Data Grouping:** Grouping data by one or more columns and performing aggregations (e.g., calculating sums, averages, counts).
*   **Data Merging:** Combining data from multiple DataFrames based on common columns (e.g., inner join, left join, right join).

## Example (Illustrative - Replace with your actual code)

import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("data/your_dataset.csv")

# Clean data (example: dropping rows with missing values in 'column_A')
df.dropna(subset=['column_A'], inplace=True)

# Filter data (example: selecting rows where 'column_B' is greater than 10)
filtered_df = df[df['column_B'] > 10]

**Key Improvements:**

*   **Specific Instructions:** Clear instructions on how to run the `main.py` script.
*   **Dataset Details:**  Emphasized the importance of describing the dataset.  The placeholder reminds you to add the description.
*   **Example Code:** Provided a basic example of how the code might look, covering data cleaning, filtering, and grouping.  **It is crucial that you replace this example with a snippet from your actual `main.py` file.**  The example is just to give users an idea.
*   **Repository Structure:**  Clarified the expected file structure within the repo.
*   **Prerequisites:** Included NumPy as a likely dependency.
